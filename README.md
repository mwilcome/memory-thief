# Memory Thief

A top-down 2D roguelite built with Python and Pygame. Infiltrate procedurally generated "mind dungeons" as a spectral thief, stealing memories to gain temporary abilities while managing corruption. Navigate a brain-like labyrinth, defeat the Core Neuron, and escape with the Core Memory before the mind collapses.

## Features

- **Procedural Dungeons**: Randomized rooms and corridors mimicking a neural network.
- **Memory Mechanics**: Absorb enemy memories for buffs (e.g., speed, invisibility) that fade over time, with a corruption trade-off.
- **Roguelite Progression**: Permadeath with permanent upgrades via memory fragments.
- **Code-Driven**: Built entirely programmaticallyâ€”no mouse, all keyboard control.

## Status

- [x] Basic player movement (WASD)
- [x] Procedural dungeon generation (rooms + corridors)
- [ ] Collision with dungeon walls
- [ ] Neuron enemies with memory drops
- [ ] Memory absorption and corruption system
- [ ] Core Memory boss and exit
